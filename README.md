2. In one terminal window, run `webdriver-manager start`
3. In another terminal window, go to **project_home/e2e** folder

## Design considerations
- No unit test was written due to my time constraints. Also there is not much logic in javascript to test. 
- Used flexbox layout instead bootstrap grid system wherever suitable.
- Used modal service from angular-ui-bootstrap to implement the pop-ups.
- Used HTML5 validation on some of form input - could use regex for validation if we need to support old browsers.
